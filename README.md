# Politiko-Search-Engine
 A tf-idf based search engine for searching from about 75 speeches of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The main purpose of this project is to understand how vector space based retrieval models work. The search engine caters to the need of journalists and politicians to seek the Prime Minister's speeches and to validate if the issues have already been addressed by the Prime Minister or not.
 Politiko - A Profession Specific Information Retrieval System

## Aim 
Created a profession specific information retrieval system pertaining to professions such as journalism, politics and law.

## Scope
Given a corpus from the Prime Minister’s speeches and a search query, we are meant to extract the speeches referencing several issues addressed in the query. We are also to indicate if a particular issue has never been addressed by the Prime Minister before.

## Order of execution
Run Jupyter notebook. 
Execute each code block (cell by cell) in code.ipynb notebook.
``$ sudo python3 code.py``

## Installing nltk
``$ pip3 install nltk``<br/>
``$ python3``<br/>
``>>> import nltk``<br/>
``>>> nltk.download()``<br/>
	``Packages: all``<br/>

## DATA STRUCTURES USED:
### Document_tokens_list
Contains lists enclosed within a list It will contain the stemmed tokens from each file in the corpus as individual lists. All are appended to make a list.<br/> 
Example:<br/>
[[‘i’,’am’,’good’],[‘isro’,’nasa’],[‘india’,’is’,’best’]]
### Vocabulary
Will contain a dictionary of all the unique words in the corpus.<br/>
